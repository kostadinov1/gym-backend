# Gym App - Backlog & Known Issues

## Bugs / Polish
- [ ] **Exercises:** Deleting a Custom Exercise fails silently if it is used in a Routine/History (Need better error message from Backend).
- [ ] **History:** "Finish" button on ActiveWorkout stays clickable even after success (need to navigate away or disable).
- [ ] **Home:** Completed routines reset at midnight (Timezone logic needs verification).

## Future Features (FFU)
- [ ] **Plans:** Create/Edit Routines UI.
- [ ] **Profile:** Statistics and User Settings.
- [ ] **Offline:** Sync engine (WatermelonDB).
